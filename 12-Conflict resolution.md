The "resolve any conflicts automatically" point in the `sf hardis work refresh` workflow refers to the tool's ability to handle various types of conflicts that can arise during the refresh process without requiring manual intervention. Here's what this typically involves:

## Types of Conflicts Resolved Automatically:

**Git Merge Conflicts:**
- When merging updates from the target branch into your feature branch, the tool can automatically resolve simple conflicts using predefined strategies
- Common auto-resolution patterns include favoring certain file types (like taking upstream changes for package.json dependencies) or using "ours" vs "theirs" strategies for specific scenarios

**Metadata Conflicts:**
- Salesforce metadata conflicts that occur when deploying refreshed metadata to your scratch org
- Examples: Permission set conflicts, profile differences, or object schema mismatches
- The tool may automatically choose the "source of truth" version (usually from the target branch)

**Dependency Conflicts:**
- Package version mismatches between your feature branch and the updated target branch
- Automatically updates to the latest compatible versions or resolves version ranges

**Configuration Conflicts:**
- Environment-specific settings that differ between branches
- Automatically applies the appropriate configuration for your development environment

## How Automatic Resolution Works:

The tool likely uses predefined rules and strategies such as:
- **Conflict resolution policies** - predetermined rules for handling specific file types or metadata
- **Fast-forward merges** when possible to avoid conflicts entirely
- **Three-way merge strategies** that intelligently combine changes
- **Fallback to safe defaults** when conflicts can't be cleanly resolved

## Limitations:

Keep in mind that truly complex conflicts (like contradictory business logic changes) will still require manual intervention. The "automatic" resolution typically handles structural, dependency, and configuration conflicts rather than semantic code conflicts.
