## Demo Scenario: Customer Portal Enhancement Project

### Business Context
**Acme Corp** needs to enhance their customer portal with new Lightning Web Components, custom objects, and Apex classes. The development must follow enterprise-grade practices with proper testing, code reviews, and staged deployments across multiple environments.

### Environment Architecture
- **Development**: Individual developer sandboxes + feature branches
- **Integration (INT)**: `integration` branch ‚Üí Integration Sandbox
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: `uat` branch ‚Üí UAT Sandbox  
- **Production (PROD)**: `main` branch ‚Üí Production Org

- **Monitoring Pipeline**: Daily org health checks and backups

---

## Phase 2: Feature Development Workflow

### 2.1 Developer Experience
**Task**: Create new "Premium Support Case" Lightning Web Component

**Developer Actions**:
1. Create feature branch: `feature/premium-support-lwc`
2. Develop components using VS Code with SFDX-Hardis extension
3. Real-time validation feedback via WebSocket connection
4. Local testing with scratch orgs

**SFDX-Hardis Benefits Demonstrated**:
- Interactive prompts for metadata deployment decisions
- Automatic code quality checks (PMD, ESLint integration)
- Smart deployment suggestions based on dependency analysis
- Real-time progress feedback during operations

### 2.2 Code Quality Gates
Before any deployment, SFDX-Hardis enforces:
- **Apex Code Coverage**: Minimum 85% (configurable)
- **Lightning Web Component Tests**: Jest unit tests required
- **Security Review**: Automated SAST scanning
- **Documentation Standards**: Inline documentation validation

---

## Phase 3: Multi-Environment Deployment Pipeline

### 3.1 Integration Environment (INT Branch)
**Trigger**: Pull request merged to `integration` branch

**Automated Workflow**:
```yaml
# Key steps in integration-deploy.yml
- Checkout code with full history
- Authenticate to Integration Sandbox
- Run smart deployment analysis
- Execute: sf hardis:project:deploy:smart --check
- Deploy if validation passes
- Run post-deployment tests
- Update deployment status in GitHub
```

**SFDX-Hardis Smart Features**:
- **Delta Deployment**: Only deploys changed metadata
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatically handles component dependencies  
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintains deployment history for quick rollbacks
- **Test Orchestration**: Runs only relevant test classes

### 3.2 UAT Environment (UAT Branch)
**Trigger**: Manual promotion after INT validation

**Enhanced Validations**:
- Full regression test suite execution
- Data migration scripts validation
- Performance impact assessment
- User acceptance criteria verification

### 3.3 Production Deployment (Main Branch)
**Trigger**: Approved release merge to `main`

**Production Safeguards**:
- **Maintenance Window Enforcement**: Deploys only during approved windows
- **Blue-Green Strategy**: Validates in production-like environment first
- **Automated Rollback**: Immediate rollback on critical failures
- **Stakeholder Notifications**: Automated deployment status updates

---

## Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring & Maintenance

### 4.1 Automated Org Health Monitoring
**Daily Scheduled Tasks** (via `monitoring.yml`):

```bash
# Comprehensive org monitoring
sf hardis:org:monitor:all --target-org production
sf hardis:org:monitor:backup --target-org production
sf hardis:org:monitor:backup --target-org uat
```

**Monitoring Capabilities**:
- **Metadata Backup**: Daily automated backups with versioning
- **Performance Metrics**: API usage, query performance, storage utilization
- **Security Compliance**: Permission changes, login anomalies
- **Data Quality**: Duplicate detection, data integrity checks

### 4.2 Proactive Issue Detection
- **Apex Error Monitoring**: Real-time exception tracking
- **Integration Health**: External API connectivity status
- **User Experience Metrics**: Page load times, component performance
- **Capacity Planning**: Storage and API limit trend analysis

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features Demonstration

### 5.1 Interactive Deployment Decisions
**Scenario**: Conflicting metadata changes detected

SFDX-Hardis provides interactive prompts:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Conflict detected in CustomObject: Account
   
Choose resolution strategy:
1. Keep source version (overwrites target)
2. Keep target version (skips deployment)  
3. Manual merge required
4. Show detailed diff

Your choice: _
```

### 5.2 Smart Metadata Analysis
**Capability**: Unused metadata detection and cleanup suggestions

```bash
sf hardis:project:clean:unused --target-org production
```

**Results**:
- Identifies orphaned Apex classes
- Detects unused custom fields
- Suggests permission set optimizations
- Calculates storage savings potential
