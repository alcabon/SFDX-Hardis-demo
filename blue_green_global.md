ðŸ“‹ Complete Implementation Guide:

- Architecture components and considerations
- Real-world deployment strategies (gradual vs immediate)
- Salesforce-specific challenges and solutions
- Monitoring, cost analysis, and ROI calculations
- Implementation checklist and best practices

ðŸš€ Key Highlights of the Blue-Green Strategy:
- Zero Downtime: Users never experience service interruption
- 30-Second Rollbacks: Instant recovery from deployment issues
- Production Validation: Test with real data before full release
- Risk Mitigation: Isolate new releases until fully validated

The diagrams show how SFDX-Hardis makes this complex orchestration manageable with intelligent automation, interactive deployment decisions, and comprehensive monitoring. This is exactly the kind of enterprise-grade DevOps capability that sets apart professional Salesforce development teams!
Would you like me to create additional diagrams for specific scenarios like canary releases or A/B testing patterns within the Blue-Green strategy?
