I'll help you understand the SFDX Hardis process for organizing git branches and managing tasks. Let me search for current information about SFDX Hardis extension capabilities and commands.Let me get more specific information about the task management and git workflow commands.Based on my research, I can explain the SFDX Hardis process for creating and managing tasks with git branch organization. Here's how the workflow works:

## Task Creation Process in SFDX Hardis

### 1. **Task Type Selection**
When creating a new task, you can choose from:
- **Feature** - New functionality development
- **Debug + Configuration** - Bug fixes and configuration changes  
- **Development** - General development work
- **Both** - Combination of feature and development work

### 2. **Git Branch Organization with Integration Branch**

The SFDX Hardis follows a structured branching strategy where `integ` serves as the first pull request target, acting as an integration branch before merging to main/master.

### 3. **VSCode Extension Button Process**

When you click the task management button in the SFDX Hardis VSCode extension, here's what happens:

#### **Underlying SFDX Hardis Command:**
```bash
sf hardis:work:new
```

#### **Process Flow:**
1. **Project Selection**: The system prompts you to select from available projects (e.g., france, build, run, uk) which will be used as the first part of the git branch name

2. **Task Naming**: Creates branch following pattern: `{project}/{type}/{dev}/{task-name}`
   - Example: `france/features/dev/JIRA123-webservice-get-account`

3. **Branch Creation**: The extension automatically creates and switches to the new feature branch

#### **Underlying Git Commands Executed:**
```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Switch to integration branch
git checkout integ
git pull origin integ

# Create and switch to new feature branch
git checkout -b {project}/{type}/dev/{task-name}

# Push new branch to remote
git push -u origin {project}/{type}/dev/{task-name}
```

### 4. **Save and Publish Current Task**

#### **SFDX Hardis Command:**
```bash
sf hardis:work:save
```

#### **Process:**
1. **Auto-cleaning**: When saving a task, the list of configured cleanings will be automatically applied to sfdx sources
2. **Metadata retrieval**: If you define metadata types, they will be retrieved using force:source:retrieve when calling hardis:scratch:pull
3. **Git operations**: Stages, commits, and pushes changes

#### **Underlying Git Commands:**
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with standardized message
git commit -m "feat: {task-description}"

# Push to remote branch
git push origin {current-branch}

# Create pull request targeting 'integ' branch
# (This depends on your Git platform - GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
```

### 5. **Configuration Requirements**

The system uses `.sfdx-hardis.yml` configuration file where you can define:
- Available projects list
- Task naming patterns (`newTaskNameRegex`)
- Auto-cleaning rules
- Branch protection rules

This workflow ensures proper git hygiene with `integ` as your integration branch, allowing for proper code review and testing before merging to production branches.
