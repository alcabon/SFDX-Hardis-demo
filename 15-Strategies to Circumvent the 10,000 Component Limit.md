You're hitting on a real challenge in large-scale Salesforce deployments. Here are several strategies to manage these constraints:

## Strategies to Circumvent the 10,000 Component Limit

**1. Sequential Batch Deployment**
- Divide your 20,000 artifacts into several logical packages of <10,000 components.
- Deploy respecting dependencies (base metadata → configuration → code).
- Use scripts to automate the sequence.

**2. Modular Approach by Business Domain**
- Segment by functional modules (Sales, Service, Marketing, etc.).
- Create independent packages with their own deployment cycles.
- Allows for better long-term maintainability.

## Recommended Tools

**SFDX/SF CLI with Custom Scripts:**
```bash
# Example of batch deployment
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/core
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/sales
sf project deploy start --source-dir force-app/main/service
```

**Gearset or Copado:** Excellent for managing smart delta deployments and profile/permission set management.

**Vlocity Build Tool / Salesforce CLI:** For Industry Cloud deployments.

## Managing Profiles and Permission Sets

**1. "Minimal Profile + Permission Sets" Strategy**
- Keep profiles with minimal permissions.
- Use Permission Sets for specific permissions.
- Easier to manage in delta deployments.

**2. Selective Permission Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy only new permission sets
sf project deploy start --metadata "PermissionSet:NewPermSet1,NewPermSet2"
```

**3. Post-Deployment Scripts**
- Apex scripts to automatically assign permissions.
- Avoids profile conflicts in production.

## Optimized Delta Deployment Strategy

**1. Dependency Analysis**
- Use `sf project list metadata` to map dependencies.
- Deploy in order: Schema → Configuration → Code → Permissions.

**2. Pre-Validation**
```bash
# Validation without deployment
sf project deploy validate --source-dir force-app --test-level RunLocalTests
```

**3. Smart Incremental Deployment**
- Use Git to identify actual changes.
- Deploy only modified components + their dependencies.
